Insights Gained:
-Tanguy Kwizera

Throughout this task, I enhanced my comprehension of Normal Distribution, discovering how the mean and standard deviation influence the curve. I also acquired knowledge of Bayesian Probability, observing how evidence modifies earlier assumptions. Executing Gradient Descent illuminated the process of optimizing model parameters across iterations. Working with my group improved my collaboration and ability to solve problems. In general, this experience successfully linked theoretical concepts with hands-on coding. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
